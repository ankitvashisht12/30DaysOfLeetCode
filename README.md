**Day 2. [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3284/)**

Description :
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Day 3. [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3285/)**

Description :
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
